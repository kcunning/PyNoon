I'm just leanring PyGame.  I used to play a game many years ago on Windows 3.1 withi this little cowboy who'd pop up on the screen and you'd have to shoot him before he shot you.

This is my python version of that game and my attempt at learning pygame.  In its current state, its procedural, not object oriented but that will be next :)

Plus, the cowboy doesn't really shoot you yet...if you miss, you die, he laughs...eventually I'll get him to pull the trigger and have some fresher graphics, etc.

I want to add stats
Death animation of cowboy
Better sounds, though these are funny :)
Configuration menu's etc to change screen size, cowboy reaction time, etc


Lotsa stuff!


OH YEAH:  run python core/core.py, wait for the whistle sound -- I really worked hard on it -- and then press any key.  Cowboy will pop up at a random moment in a random spot on the "screen".  If you miss, you die, screen turns red, he laughs, hit a key to reset.
