I'm just leanring PyGame.  I used to play a game many years ago on Windows 3.1 withi this little cowboy who'd pop up on the screen and you'd have to shoot him before he shot you.

This is my python version of that game and my attempt at learning pygame.  In its current state, its procedural, not object oriented but that will be next :)

Plus, the cowboy doesn't really shoot you yet...if you miss, you die, he laughs...eventually I'll get him to pull the trigger and have some fresher graphics, etc.

Anyway...blah blah blah
